# Thesis Title
## Improving Deep Neural Networks Based Speech Recognition System For Far-field Speech

# Abstract

Nowadays, the research focus of automatic speech recognition (ASR)
task is shifting from the close-talk scenario towards the far-field scenario. It is considered as a more practical but challenging task as the
input data contains noise, reverberation or overlapped speech. This
work aims at improving the overall performance in far-field speech
recognition task by applying the latest deep learning technologies. In
order to achieve this goal, this work experiments with the beamforming technology on multi-array microphone data, improvement of language model module, and development of the acoustic model module
for far-field ASR system by using multi-layer perceptron, convolutional
neural network, and very deep convolutional neural networks. This
work demonstrates the effectiveness of feature space maximum likelihood linear regression based feature extraction technique and very
leaky rectified linear unit activation function over others to achieve
better accuracy and word error based performance in the far-field domain. This work also shows that, the improvement of the language
model and the pronunciation dictionary is extremely crucial in overall
system performance improvement as the acoustic model is not strong
with the relatively sparse far-field data.
